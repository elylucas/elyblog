Hi, my name is Ely and I am a Denver based software developer, speaker, and writer. I do a lot of work around rich web applications in the Microsoft stack, and am exploring other frameworks/languages such as Node and Python. I also dabble a bit in Android and iOS development both natively and through hybrid PhoneGap apps. I run the Boulder .Net user group, and have been known to organize a conference or two.

I blog about what I am learning, some tidbits I find useful, and whatever else I find interesting in the world of software development. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter at [@elylucas][1].
