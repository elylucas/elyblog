Sorry this is a few days late, but I have finally uploaded my demo from my talk at last Monday’s <a href="http://www.denvervisualstudio.net" target="_blank">Denver Visual Studio.Net User Group</a>

If you were there, thanks for coming out and seeing our community launch event for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; We had a packed house of 100+ people, and had a great time.

In order to run this demo, you will need the Entity Framework Code First CTP4 binaries.&#160; See <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/16/code-first-development-with-entity-framework-4.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie’s post</a> about EF4 code first and info on how to download it
