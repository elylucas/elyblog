After months of beta, XNA Game Studio Express 1.0&nbsp;is now available.&nbsp; Head over to the <a href="http://www.msdn.com/xna" target="_blank">XNA center</a> on MSDN to download it.&nbsp; 

For those of you who don&#8217;t know what XNA or GSE is, here is a little more info.&nbsp; XNA is a new suite of products and technologies Microsoft is releasing for the Game Development community.&nbsp; GSE is a free developer environment that runs on top of C# Express, and is&nbsp;for developing games for both Windows and the Xbox 360.&nbsp; For more information, check out the XNA <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.

I have been working on the first set of tutorials for beginning game development, and now that GSE is gold it is time to get them published.&nbsp; Hopefully I can have the first one up by this weekend.
