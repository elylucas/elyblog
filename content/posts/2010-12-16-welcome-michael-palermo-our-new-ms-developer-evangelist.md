Its been awhile, but the Desert Mountain region (Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Southern Nevada), has a new Developer Evangelist from Microsoft.&#160; Michael Palermo will be filling the role left by Rob Bagby, and will be supporting us in the Colorado area.&#160; DEâ€™s are developers that support developers, and work closely with the community as well as with the MS product teams.
