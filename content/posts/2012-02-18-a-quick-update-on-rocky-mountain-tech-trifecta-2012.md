I have been getting a lot of inquiries on what or if anything is happening with the Rocky Mountain Tech this year. &nbsp;And rightfully so, as it has nearly been a year since last year&#8217;s Trifecta took place. &nbsp;

The answer to these questions is yes, there will be a Trifecta this year, and that I am currently trying to nail down the dates and logistics with our venue. &nbsp;I wanted to host the Trifecta around a month later this year compared to years past, but it looks like it will be a bit longer wait then that. &nbsp;I should have everything worked out in the next few days, and will be announcing the date soon, so stay tuned to <a href="http://www.rmtechtrifecta.com" target="_blank">www.rmtechtrifecta.com</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rmtechtrifecta" target="_blank">@rmtechtrifecta</a>.
