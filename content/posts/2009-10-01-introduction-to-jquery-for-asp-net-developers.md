On Friday, October 23rd, I will be giving a hands on lab featuring an introduction to jQuery for the ASP.Net web forms developer:

> _“JQuery is an open source JavaScript library that can be used to build rich, interactive, client side applications. Recently, Microsoft has announced that jQuery will be integrated into both ASP.NET web forms and ASP.NET MVC frameworks, which means the time is now to become familiar with jQuery and discover how this powerful library can help your applications. In this lab, Ely will go over how to build interactive apps using the jQuery, especially geared towards the ASP.NET Web Forms programmer.”_

The labs are a part of the Denver Visual Studio.Net user group, and are held the Friday before the user group meeting (which is the fourth Monday of every month).&#160; There is no registration required, so feel free to stop by and gets some hands on love with jQuery.
