So everyone needs the obligatory "First blog post" on their site, so here is mine.&nbsp; Welcome everyone, and thanks for visiting my site.&nbsp; I hope to use this site as an outlet to start writing more often, whether it be about code, gaming, humor, or other stuff.

I just got this installation of Community Server up and running, and so far, I have to say I am quite impressed with it.&nbsp; It was fairly simple to get up and running, even though it could use some work on the documentation.&nbsp; I had to troll the forums for awhile to figure out how to get a <a href="http://blog.danbartels.com/archive/2005/12/27/1138.aspx" target="_blank">single blog at the root of the site</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also happy with some of the standard themes that come with the package, and might stick with this Paperclip Summer theme for awhile, or at least until I figure out how to customize it a bit.

I am very excited about the upcoming release of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/" target="_blank">XNA</a> GSE next week, and plan to do some tutorial articles on what I learn about game development playing around with the product.
