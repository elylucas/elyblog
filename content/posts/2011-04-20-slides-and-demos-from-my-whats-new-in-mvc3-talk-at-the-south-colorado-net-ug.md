Thanks everyone who came out to hear my talk on the cool new features in MVC3 last week at the [South Colorado.NET][1]UG.&#160; During the talk, I only got about 2/3 of the way through the demos, but if you like, you can download the demo code and take a look at the MVC Scaffolding and the integrated Dependency Injection support that MVC3 now has.
