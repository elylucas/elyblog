I am pleased to announce the formation of a new study group focusing on .Net technologies coming to the Denver DTC area.&#160; The study group is a sub group of the Denver Visual Studio.Net User Group.&#160; We will meet on the first and third Thursdays of the month during the lunch hours (11:30 to 12:30ish).&#160; We will focus on a wide range of technologies that the .Net developer will be interested in learning. 

Our first session will be on Thursday, June 17th (3rd Thursday of June).&#160; For our fist few sessions, we will be diving into Asp.Net MVC 2.0.&#160; Anyone is free to join us.&#160; For more information, join the Denver Visual Studio.Net user group on LinkedIn ([http://tinyurl.com/DVSUGonLinkedIn][1]), and then join our Denver .Net Study Sub Group.&#160;
