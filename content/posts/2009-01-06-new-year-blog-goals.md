I've never been one for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.&nbsp; I don't think they work.&nbsp; Every year people make resolutions and usually stop following them within a few weeks.&nbsp; However, I do believe in making goals, so I don't see any problem in making some goals for myself for 2009.&nbsp; Here is a quick list of what I have planned: 

Lose some weight:
  
I have ballooned up to 240 pounds.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; When I graduated high school a little over ten years ago, I weighted 140 pounds.&nbsp; Working at a desk for ten years and having really poor eating habits has added a lot of stress to my frame.&nbsp; I would like to get around 200 pounds over the next year.&nbsp; I know having a goal of straight weight loss is not really a good goal, instead I would rather base it off of body fat percentages.&nbsp; As soon as I get what my current body fat percent is, I'll have a better idea of what to set my goals for. 

Get a MCPD certification:
  
I've been studying to take the 70-536 .Net Application Framework Fundamentals for a couple of months now, and will be taking the test in about a month.&nbsp; In 2009, I want to take the next two exams to complete the whole certification. 

Take nine college courses:
  
I've been going to Regis University for the past four years.&nbsp; I am about half way through my junior year.&nbsp; Taking nine courses in 2009 will get me real close to completing my computer science degree in 2010. 

Blog more often:
  
I want to start taking this blog more seriously and write regularly.&nbsp; My goal will be to post weekly, whether it is updates to my 2009 goals or my adventures in technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;
