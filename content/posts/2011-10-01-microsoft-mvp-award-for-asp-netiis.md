I was honored this morning when I checked my email and discovered that I have been awarded a Microsoft MVP Award in ASP.Net/IIS for the 2011/2012 year.&#160; This was a great surprise and I’m excited to be joining a group of people I highly regard in the community.

For those of you not familiar with the MVP program, Microsoft MVP’s are those individuals that share their time and knowledge with the developer community around Microsoft tools and technologies.&#160; They might be leaders of user groups, speakers, prolific bloggers, authors, or just anyone who enriches the community they participate in.&#160; For more information on the MVP program, check out the MVP site on Microsoft: <http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/>

I would like to take the time to thank some of the local MVP’s in the Colorado area for their great contributions, and for providing leadership and mentorship to me.&#160; These individuals include (but not limited to):

I’m excited to be joining this group of distinguished individuals, and hope I can live up to the high standard they have set before me.
