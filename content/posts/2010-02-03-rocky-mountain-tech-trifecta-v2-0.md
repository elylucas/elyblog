Last year was the first Rocky Mountain Tech Trifecta, and it was a blast.&#160; Nearly 400 developers, DBAs and IT admins descended into Denver and took part.&#160; It is an all day code camp/server camp/PASS camp.&#160; The event is happening again this year, Saturday February 27th.&#160; Iâ€™ll be speaking again at this years event, this time on jQuery for .Net Developers.&#160; Go to the site <http://www.rmtechtrifecta.com> and check out the schedule and register now!
