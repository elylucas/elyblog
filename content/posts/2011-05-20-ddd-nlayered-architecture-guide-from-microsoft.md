The Platform Architecture Team at Microsoft has published a mammoth (~500ish pages) guide on doing Domain Driven Architecture on the .Net platform.&#160; I have only browsed through it so far, but it looks to have some pretty good information if you are wondering on different techniques in architecting your application. 

Go here to read their blog post about the guide and download it:

There is also a sample application on codeplex that accompanies the guide available here:

Happy Coding!
