If you live (or are visiting) the Denver area come February 21st, come check out the Rocky Mountain Tech Tri-Fecta, an all day IT event focusing on .Net, Windows Server, and SQL Server.&nbsp; There are going to be some big name speakers coming from out of town, including <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>, and some great local speakers such as <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/kathleen" target="_blank">Kathleen Dollard</a>, <a href="http://jmayo.spaces.live.com" target="_blank">Joe Mayo</a>, <a href="http://blog.davidyack.com/" target="_blank">David Yack</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bags" target="_blank">Rob Bagby</a>, and <a href="http://www.joeshirey.com/" target="_blank">Joe Shirey</a>.&nbsp; This event is going to be great, and best of all it is free.&nbsp; I have submitted a few talk abstracts to try to break into speaking, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll be up there as well getting my feet wet with this esteemed panel of speakers.&nbsp; For more information and to register, go to the website <a href="http://www.rmtechtrifecta.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
